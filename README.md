# Healthcare-Accessibility-in-Africa Power Bi Case study.
A Power BI case study analyzing healthcare access disparities in Africa, comparing rural and urban regions, funding efficiency, and emergency response capabilities using interactive dashboards.

# Project Overview
- This project investigates the disparities in healthcare accessibility across African countries. The analysis focuses on rural vs. urban differences, healthcare workforce distribution, funding allocation, and patient satisfaction metrics. A capstone project using Power BI to analyze healthcare access disparities and funding efficiency across African regions.

# Objective
- To provide actionable, data-driven insights for policymakers and stakeholders to improve healthcare equity and funding efficiency.

# Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (Data Visualization)
- Microsoft Excel (Data Preprocessing)
- DAX (for calculated measures and KPIs)

# Key Areas Explored
- Rural vs. Urban healthcare infrastructure
- Workforce availability (doctors & nurses)
- Patient access and satisfaction
- Funding impact on healthcare delivery
- Emergency response time analysis

# Key Questions Answered
- How does healthcare facility distribution vary by region?
- Are funding levels linked to facility performance?
- Which facility types are the most cost-efficient?

# Insights & Recommendations
- Targeted investment in underserved rural areas
- Resource reallocation based on performance metrics
- Improved data-driven healthcare policies

# Project Structure
/data → Raw healthcare datasets
 /dashboards → Power BI report (.pbix) 
 /visuals → Exported images from dashboards
 /analysis-notes → Observations and summary notes

# Outcome
An interactive Power BI report that effectively communicates disparities in healthcare access and supports strategic planning for equitable service delivery across Africa while offering strategic insights for decision makers.

# Personal Reflection
This project was my first deep dive into Power BI and it really showed me how powerful visualization can be in telling a story. Understanding how funding and workforce availability translate to actual patient outcomes made the data feel human. I especially enjoyed transforming raw numbers into visuals that could drive real-world decisions. This pushed me to think not just like an analyst, but like a communicator.
